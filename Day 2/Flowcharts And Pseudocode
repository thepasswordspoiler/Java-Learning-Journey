Day 2: Flowcharts and Pseudocode

📌 Introduction
Before writing Java code, it's important to understand problem-solving techniques using flowcharts and pseudocode. These tools help visualize logic before implementation.

1️⃣ What is a Flowchart?
A flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm using symbols to show the flow of execution.

🔹 Basic Flowchart Symbols
Symbol	Meaning
🔷 Oval	Start / End
🔲 Rectangle	Process / Action
🔺 Diamond	Decision (Yes/No, True/False)
🔽 Arrow	Flow Direction


📊 Example: Flowchart for Finding the Largest of Two Numbers
Problem: Given two numbers, find the larger one.

    Start
      |
  Input A, B
      |
  A > B ?
  /     \
Yes      No
 |        |
Print A   Print B
 |        |
 End      End


2️⃣ What is Pseudocode?
Pseudocode is a simplified way of writing an algorithm in plain English using programming-like structure.

🔹 Example: Pseudocode for Finding the Largest of Two Numbers

BEGIN
    INPUT A, B
    IF A > B THEN
        PRINT "A is larger"
    ELSE
        PRINT "B is larger"
    ENDIF
END


📝 Practice Problems
Try writing flowcharts and pseudocode for the following:

Find whether a number is even or odd.
Calculate the sum of the first N natural numbers.
Find the largest among three numbers.
